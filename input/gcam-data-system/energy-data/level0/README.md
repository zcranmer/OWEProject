# Note about proprietary data files

This directory previously contained two files called en_OECD.csv and
en_nonOECD.csv.  These have been removed because the data is
proprietary, and the terms of our license do not permit us to
distribute it.  The GCAM data preprocessing system will not run
without these files, but users with their own copies of the data can
install them here to restore the functionality.  We hope to have an
alternative solution in place for users without access to this data
soon.
