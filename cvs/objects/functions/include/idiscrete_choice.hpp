 * \brief Base class for discrete choice model class hierarchy
 * \details Subclasses of this class describe different formulae for
 *          imputing shares to competing options with different
 *          prices.  The classes gather in a single place the
 *          functions for calculating the discrete choice function and
 *          computing share weights 
 * \todo Bring the getPrice methods for the sectors and and subsectors
 *       into these classes so that we can calculate proper average
 *       costs.
