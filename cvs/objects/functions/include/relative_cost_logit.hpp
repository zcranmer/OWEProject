 * \brief The relative cost logit based discrete choice function.
 * \details A more technical description for the relative cost logit function is
 *          the Weibull variant of the logit, as described in Clarke &
 *          Edmonds (1993).
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for RelativeCostLogit</b>
 *          - XML name: \c RelativeCostLogit::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: Sector and Subsector
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: None
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c "logit-exponent" RelativeCostLogit::mLogitExponent
 *                   The logit exponent used to describe the width of the distribution.
 *
 * \warning In this formulation of the logit function negative prices can not be
 *          tolerated see RelativeCostLogit::calcUnnormalizedShare for how these
 *          situations are handled.
