 * \brief The absolute cost logit based discrete choice function.
 * \details A more technical description for the absolute cost logit function is
 *          the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) variant of the logit discrete choice
 *          function.
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for AbsoluteCostLogit</b>
 *          - XML name: \c AbsoluteCostLogit::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: Sector and Subsector
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: None
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c "logit-exponent" AbsoluteCostLogit::mLogitExponent
 *                   The logit exponent used to describe the width of the distribution.
 *              - \c "base-cost" AbsoluteCostLogit::mBaseCost
 *                   The base cost that sets the scale for cost differences.
