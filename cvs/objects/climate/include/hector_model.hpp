/*!
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief IClimateModel interface wrapper for the Hector climate model
 *
 * \details This wrapper class handles communication with the Hector
 *          climate model.  These communications comprise setting
 *          emissions, retrieving climate outputs (temperature,
 *          forcing, etc), and starting runs.  Hector is set up to run
 *          on a period-by-period basis, so at the end of each GCAM
 *          period emissions can be set, the climate model run up to
 *          the current date, and climate outputs retrieved.  All of
 *          these communications are performed using the Hector core's
 *          messaging capability.
 *
 *          The wrapper keeps track of the last year we ran up to.  If
 *          the input year is less than or equal to the last year we
 *          ran to, then we re-initialize Hector, re-run its spin-up,
 *          and run up to the requested date.  This allows us to use
 *          the Hector module in a batch run (where we will reset at
 *          the beginning of each new scenario) or in a stabilization
 *          run (where we might have to run each stabilization period
 *          many times to find the right GHG tax).
