 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief A class which will link a policy to another GHGPolicy which really
 *        drives the policy.
 * \details This policy does not set a constraint or price itself, it assumes the
 *          policy it links to will.  It merely allows additional gasses to be
 *          included into the policy it links to.  This class allows a price
 *          multiplier to adjust the price of the linked policy which could be to
 *          adjust for global warming potential or just turn "off" price feedbacks.
 *          Similarly a multiplier exists for the quantity value of the gas as well.
 *          Note that these multipliers can change over time to simulate a "phase in"
 *          of the gas into the policy at a later time.

 *          <b>XML specification for LinkedGHGPolicy</b>
 *          - XML name: \c LinkedGHGPolicy::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: region
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: \c name LinkedGHGPolicy::mName
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c market LinkedGHGPolicy::mMarket
 *                   The name of the market to create blocks of regions which share this
 *                   policy.
 *              - \c linked-policy LinkedGHGPolicy::mLinkedPolicyName
 *                   The name of the ghg policy to link to.  This name and the current
 *                   region's name will be used to look up the market and link to it.
 *              - \c price-unit LinkedGHGPolicy::mPriceUnits
 *                   A label for the units of the price of this market for reporting
 *                   which may differ from the linked market if the price adjust is
 *                   converting units.
 *              - \c output-unit LinkedGHGPolicy::mOutputUnits
 *                   A label for the units of the quantity of this market for reporting
 *                   which may differ from the linked market if the demand adjust is
 *                   converting units.
 *              - \c price-adjust LinkedGHGPolicy::mPriceAdjust
 *                   A multiplier on the price of the linked market to allow for GWP
 *                   unit conversion or to turn "off" price feedbacks.
 *              - \c price-adjust LinkedGHGPolicy::mPriceAdjust
 *                   A multiplier on the quantity added to the linked market to allow
 *                   for GWP unit conversion or to turn "off" inclusion in a constraint.
